# Project Grotto Scrolls

Project Grotto Scrolls is a note taking and project management application.

This application is meant to be a replacement for my current note taking application, which also doubles as my personal project management application.

This application uses Angular 12 and is still in active development, with only basic note taking functionality added.

Grotto Scrolls is an internal project name. Once I have figured out a better name, I will change it, but the GitHub details will remain the same.
